"Your task is to study and understand the structure and specific values of a large dataset, and then answer a question based on it. The dataset records ranks of countries' scores at different elite quality levels, calculated through a hierarchical tree structure, encompassing over one hundred and fifty countries. Please always remember, the data only contains the ranks, no orignal scores data. Specifically, a PEQx score is calculated for each country, and the rank of PEQx is the most important. The score of PEQx is derived from the values of 'Index Areas', which represent the indices at the next lower level. In turn, the scores of these subordinate level indicators are calculated from the values of indices at an even lower level within the hierarchy.\n\n# Dataset description:\n\n## Index Levels:\n- **PEQx:** Highest index level for each country.\n- **Index Area:** Specific areas contributing to the PEQx.\n- **Pillar:** Sub-components of each Index Area.\n- **Indicator:** Detailed metrics contributing to each Pillar.\n\n## Column Names:\nThe dataset columns are structured as follows:\n- **Country Name**\n- **Country Code**\n- **Index Level**\n- **Index Element Code**\n- **Index Element Name**\n- Yearly scores from 2005 to 2024.\n\nHigher scores indicate better performance. Each row records a score for each year, allowing for year-over-year comparisons.\n\n## Example Rows:\n\n### PEQx Level:\n```\nCountry Name | Country Code | Index Level | Index Element Code | Index Element Name | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 | 2005\nAustralia    | AUS          | PEQx        | PEQx               | PEQx               | 52.906 | 52.906 | 52.893 | 51.923 | 50.719 | 51.41  | 52.793 | 53.638 | 57.133 | 53.876 | 53.66  | 55.322 | 56.886 | 55.08  | 55.924 | 57.318 | 54.402 | 54.219 | 52.602 | 53.982\nFinland      | FIN          | PEQx        | PEQx               | PEQx               | 58.781 | 58.781 | 59.432 | 58.529 | 58.909 | 56.828 | 56.391 | 57.998 | 60.242 | 58.772 | 61.626 | 62.88  | 61.055 | 62.554 | 62.959 | 60.34  | 61.454 | 62.713 | 61.67  | 62.46\n```\n\n### Index Area Level:\n```\nCountry Name | Country Code | Index Level | Index Element Code | Index Element Name | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 | 2005\nAustralia    | AUS          | Index Area  | i                  | Political Power    | 64.438 | 64.438 | 64.536 | 62.929 | 63.495 | 62.078 | 62.319 | 63.425 | 65.557 | 65.049 | 64.444 | 64.37  | 64.411 | 65.081 | 64.786 | 63.978 | 63.98  | 63.275 | 62.706 | 63.609\nBelgium      | BEL          | Index Area  | iii                | Political Value    | 49.175 | 49.175 | 49.306 | 48.765 | 47.145 | 46.678 | 47.038 | 46.19  | 44.031 | 46.12  | 45.76  | 46.161 | 44.679 | 45.217 | 45.986 | 43.958 | 45.352 | 46.477 | 45.564 | 46.772\n```\n\n### Pillar Level:\n```\nCountry Name | Country Code | Index Level | Index Element Code | Index Element Name | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 | 2005\nAustralia    | AUS          | Pillar      | iii.7              | Giving Income      | 64.854 | 64.854 | 64.854 | 63.603 | 63.755 | 63.822 | 64.143 | 64.058 | 64.329 | 64.157 | 63.542 | 64.076 | 63.039 | 63.928 | 65.246 | 63.015 | 62.222 | 63.851 | 63.047 | 63.535\nBelgium      | BEL          | Pillar      | iv.12              | Labor Value        | 36.212 | 36.212 | 41.374 | 47.572 | 62.302 | 53.273 | 50.11  | 39.689 | 54.804 | 50.355 | 54.924 | 51.411 | 50.547 | 47.617 | 49.953 | 52.029 | 44.481 | 44.299 | 38.984 | 46.656\n```\n\n### Indicator Level:\n```\nCountry Name | Country Code | Index Level | Index Element Code | Index Element Name | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 | 2005\nAustralia    | AUS          | Indicator   | i.1_INE            | Top 10% share of pre-tax national income | 63.778 | 63.778 | 63.778 | 63.899 | 64.225 | 63.891 | 60.614 | 59.04  | 60.721 | 59.698 | 57.66  | 58.307 | 56.748 | 56.812 | 57.838 | 55.533 | 59.739 | 62.761 | 63.648 | 64.362\nBelgium      | BEL          | Indicator   | iii.9_CDD          | CO2 emissions embodied in domestic final demand per capita | 31.635 | 31.635 | 31.635 | 31.635 | 31.635 | 31.635 | 31.635 | 32.106 | 31.992 | 30.87  | 32.523 | 32.655 | 31.696 | 31.844 | 31.676 | 33.784 | 31.917 | 36.33  | 35.712 | 33.263\n```\n\n When answering, focus on the latest year for direct comparisons and on year-over-year trends for developmental queries.
